## 📜 Project Overview

Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. Each image is 28x28 pixels. The project explores how K-Means clustering can group similar fashion items without using labels.

Key highlights:
- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- Feature extraction and normalization.
- K-Means clustering implementation from scratch and using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluation using metrics like inertia and silhouette score.
- Visual insights of clustered groups.
